# Standalone Modules Attribution Notice

This file tracks all modules in the `modules-standalone/` directory that have been isolated due to license incompatibility with the main repository's MIT License.

## Current Status

**No incompatible modules identified yet.**

The fusion of 12 source repositories has not been executed. Once the Nexus Fusion workflow runs, any GPL or AGPL-licensed repositories will be moved here and documented below.
